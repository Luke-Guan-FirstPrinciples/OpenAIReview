"""Per-perturbation substantive-error verifier (validation test #5).

Runs AFTER validate_perturbations has applied its 4 structural checks. For each
surviving perturbation, a strong-model verifier is asked a narrow question:

  Given (original → perturbed), does the cited contradicts_quote — together with
  the perturbation's related passages — establish that this is a substantive,
  detectable error by a careful reader with access to the paper alone?

Three verdicts:
  - "substantive"   → keep
  - "typo-shaped"   → reject (surface slip, fixed in the reader's head)
  - "not-an-error"  → reject (no real contradiction)

The generator sees ALL candidates together and picks a subset. Each verifier
sees ONE perturbation at a time, with only that perturbation's own related
passages — so its verdicts are independent of any cross-candidate reasoning
the generator did.

Verifiers are fanned out via ThreadPoolExecutor. chat() is thread-safe
(stateless underneath) and already handles retries and reasoning-token budget.

You are verifying whether a seeded error in an academic math paper is SUBSTANTIVE or TYPO-SHAPED.

- A SUBSTANTIVE error changes a claim, theorem, definition, or computation. Its
  contradiction is visible to a careful reader who connects the perturbed span to a specific passage in the paper.
- A TYPO-SHAPED error is a surface slip the reader fixes in their head (e.g., one sign flip in a standalone equation, a symbol swap with no downstream use).
- NOT AN ERROR means the "perturbation" is actually consistent with the paper, or the cited quote does not contradict it.

You are given ONE perturbation to judge, and ONE quote from elsewhere in the paper
({quote_source}). Judge only whether the shown quote and the perturbed span establish a
substantive contradiction. Do NOT speculate about what else the paper might say.

VERIFIER_PROMPT = r"""
You are verifying whether a seeded error in an academic math paper is SUBSTANTIVE or TYPO-SHAPED.

A SUBSTANTIVE error changes a claim, theorem, definition, or computation in a way a careful
reader would recognize as a real disagreement with another part of the paper. A TYPO-SHAPED
error is a surface slip the reader mentally repairs on the spot — malformed math, a bare
symbol swap to an undefined letter, a local index shift never referenced again.

Tie-breaking rules when you are unsure:
  - If the perturbed span is MALFORMED in isolation (or obviously local and never referenced),
    choose typo-shaped.
  - If NO QUOTE is available and the perturbation is a bare symbol swap (one identifier
    replaced with another) or a local index shift, choose typo-shaped — even without
    corroborating evidence, bare symbol swaps to undefined/differently-bound letters and
    purely-local index shifts are structurally typo-shaped.
  - If the perturbed span is well-formed and you simply cannot verify a contradiction from
    the shown quote (because the quote is too vague, or describes the variable abstractly),
    choose not-an-error — not typo-shaped. "Not-an-error" means "I cannot conclude this is
    wrong from what I was given", and is the correct verdict whenever Step 2 fails below
    AND the perturbed span is not itself structurally typo-shaped.
  - Between substantive and typo-shaped, choose typo-shaped.

JUDGMENT PROCEDURE (work through these in order; any NO → typo-shaped or not-an-error):

Step 1 — Self-coherence check (on the PERTURBED span alone).
  Is the perturbed span internally well-formed when read in isolation?
  Examples of FAILURE (→ typo-shaped):
    - Mixed-direction inequality chain like "0 < w > L/2" or "a \le b \ge c".
    - Broken sandwich like "a \ge b \le c".
    - Type/unit mismatches obvious without context (e.g. "T = N_T / \Delta_t" where T is a time
      but the product N_T \Delta_t has time units and the quotient does not).
    - Operator salad (two binary operators back to back with no operand).
    - A symbol replaced with a letter not bound anywhere in the quote or original span.

Step 2 — Quote specificity.
  Does the quote literally state the original value/symbol/operator (or an obviously
  equivalent form)? A quote that only mentions the same variable or the same topic is NOT
  enough. If the quote does not concretely state the original → not-an-error.

Step 3 — Downstream dependence.
  Would the perturbation propagate through the paper's downstream math?
  For numeric_parameter: is the specific value reused (in derivations, proofs, numerical
    results)? If the value is stated once and never used again → typo-shaped.
  For index_or_subscript on a summation or interval: is the boundary term plausibly NONZERO,
    AND is the sum/interval referenced or reused? A pure re-indexing that doesn't change the
    sum's value (or where the sum is never reused) → typo-shaped.
  For operator_or_sign: does the flipped operator actually change a statement the paper
    elsewhere relies on? A lone sign in a standalone equation that is never reused →
    typo-shaped.
  For symbol_binding: almost always typo-shaped. The only exception is when the replacement
    symbol is independently defined in the paper with an incompatible type/role, and the
    swap creates a well-formed but false statement. Bare letter swaps (alpha → gamma, A_i →
    X_i, \beta → \phi) are typo-shaped.

NEGATIVE EXAMPLES (both should be classified typo-shaped):

  (a) Perturbed: "$0 < w > L/2$". Quote mentions "w < L/2". Verdict: typo-shaped — the
      perturbed chain is malformed (mixed direction); Step 1 fails.

  (b) Original: "$\beta_k$". Perturbed: "$\phi_k$". Quote: "... their own weight $\beta_k$".
      Verdict: typo-shaped — bare symbol swap to an undefined letter; Step 3 fails for
      symbol_binding (no independent binding of $\phi_k$).

POSITIVE EXAMPLE (should be classified substantive):

  Original: "$10^{{-6}}$". Perturbed: "$10^{{-3}}$". Quote: "number of Newton iterations
  before the desired accuracy of $10^{{-6}}$ is reached". Verdict: substantive — quote states
  the original value verbatim (Step 2), and the accuracy threshold governs the numerical
  experiment (Step 3).

Answer each item with Y or N. Be literal — do not infer beyond what is shown.

C1. Is the perturbed span well-formed when read in isolation?
    Answer N if it has any of but not limited to: mixed-direction inequality chain (e.g.
    "0 < w > L/2"), broken sandwich (e.g. "a >= b <= c"), operator salad
    (two binary operators with no operand), obvious type/unit mismatch,
    or contains a symbol/letter not bound anywhere in the original or quote.
    Otherwise Y.

C2. Does the quote literally state the ORIGINAL value/symbol/operator
    (or an obviously equivalent form)?
    Mentioning the same variable name or topic abstractly does NOT count.
    The quote must concretely state the original. Otherwise N.

C3. Does the perturbation alter something the quote (or its directly
    implied downstream math) relies on?
    Answer N for: a numeric value the quote shows is stated only once and
    never reused; a sign/operator flip in a standalone equation never
    referenced by the quote.
    Otherwise Y.

C4. (structural) Is the perturbed form structurally typo-shaped
    regardless of evidence — one of:
    (a) a bare symbol swap whose replacement letter is not bound
        anywhere in the paper; or
    (b) a re-indexing that leaves the expression algebraically
        unchanged (dummy-variable rename like \sum_i \to \sum_j, or
        simultaneous bound + index shift like \sum_{{i=0}}^n a_i \to

L3. Does the perturbation break the chain of inference?
    - missing_case: the deleted case is non-trivial (its conclusion is not
      forced by the remaining cases).
    - induction: the base case is now wrong, or the inductive step no

- original: the original text span from the paper

Judge each perturbation INDEPENDENTLY. Do not let the assessment of one perturbation influence another. Treat surrounding_context and related_passages as ground truth from the original paper, even if they overlap with the location of another perturbation in the batch.

PERTURBATIONS:
{perturbations_json}

For EACH perturbation, answer four items with Y or N. Be literal — judge from the inputs above only.

I1. (well-formed) Is the perturbed span well-formed when read in isolation?
    Answer N for any of: a mixed-direction inequality chain (e.g. "0 < w > L/2"),
    a broken sandwich (e.g. "a >= b <= c"), operator salad (two binary operators
    with no operand), obvious type/unit mismatch, garbled grammar, a sentence
    that parses but is meaningless, "by induction on the empty set"-style
    nonsense, a step that names variables not bound anywhere, a definition with
    undefined symbols / mismatched arity / missing required quantifiers, or a
    symbol/letter not bound in the original, surrounding_context, or
    related_passages. Otherwise Y.

I2. (evidence available) Is there a basis to judge the perturbation against?
    Y if EITHER:
      (a) surrounding_context or related_passages contain something CONCRETE
          that the original span establishes or relates to — a stated value,
          definition, applied theorem, methodological detail, named result,
          stated fact, or downstream use of the same symbol/quantity/concept;
      OR
      (b) the perturbed text alone introduces a self-evidencing methodological
          or interpretive flaw that a careful reader would catch on domain
          norms — e.g. post-hoc selection ("we tested several definitions and
          kept the one that gave the best result"), removed multiple-testing
          correction, treating a p-value as P(null|data), claiming probability 1
          for a probabilistic result, or other textbook violations.
    Mentioning the topic abstractly does NOT count for (a); the evidence must
    be a concrete claim about the same object. Otherwise N.

I3. (contradiction confirmed) Does the perturbation contradict that evidence,
    given the perturbation's error_type?
    - Surface (numeric_parameter, operator_or_sign, index_or_subscript,
      computation, symbol_binding): does the perturbed value/symbol/operator
      now disagree with how the same quantity appears in surrounding_context
      or related_passages?
    - incorrect_claim_theoretical: does the perturbation alter the statement
      so that an application of it visible in surrounding_context or
      related_passages no longer goes through?
    - Logic (missing_case, induction, circular_reasoning, invalid_implication):
      does the perturbed step now break the chain of inference toward what
      the proof is trying to establish? (missing_case: the deleted case is
      non-trivial; induction: base case wrong, or step no longer reduces n+1
      to n; circular_reasoning: a step now invokes the very claim being
      proved; invalid_implication: a reversed/dropped arrow now allows
      conclusions ruled out by context.)
    - Empirical (incorrect_statement_empirical, misinterp, causal_reversed,
      p_hacking): does the perturbed claim now disagree with a fact
      established in surrounding_context or related_passages, OR introduce a
      methodological flaw the original explicitly avoided (post-hoc
      selection, removed correction, reversed causal direction)?
    Y if a careful reader could point at the contradiction; N if the
    modification leaves the perturbation unrefuted by the available evidence.

I4. (typo-shaped / cosmetic) Is the perturbed form structurally typo-shaped or
    cosmetically equivalent regardless of evidence — one of: a bare symbol
    swap whose replacement letter is not bound anywhere; a re-indexing that
    leaves the expression algebraically unchanged (dummy-variable rename like
    \sum_i \to \sum_j; simultaneous bound + index shift); a synonym swap; a
    reordering of equivalent clauses; renaming bound variables; permuting a
    case ordering; dropping a manifestly redundant case; a hedging tweak
    ("few" ↔ "some") that does not flip the conclusion?
    Y if yes; N otherwise.

Return ONLY a single JSON array (no commentary). One object per input
perturbation, keyed by perturbation_id (NOT by list order — the consumer binds
on perturbation_id). Include every perturbation_id from the input. The verdict
will be computed downstream from your answers — do not output a verdict yourself.

text that pinpoints the issue you cited (the malformed token, the contradicted
